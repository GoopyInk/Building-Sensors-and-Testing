# Building-Sensors-and-Testing
Work for Energy-Efficient and Health Buildings within Dr. Yuanyuan Shi lab

Building Model-3D.usdz is a 3D CAD Model to showcase the building made, materials replicate the material used within the building. 

Building_Sensor_Implementation.ino is the Arduino code used to send data from the ESP32 to the Raspberry Pi from a server run on the Pi. 

web_ex.py creates a webserver for storing data sent from an ESP32 that colects the data from SCD30 Sensor. 

Further parts to be added: 
- OpenFoam simulation using the Building model 
- Fully built model images
- Readings and examples of the software being run together
- Testing Critera for sensors and data collected
- Parts List
- Expanded Explanations for each part
